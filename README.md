### Finite Element Solver for Transient Heat Conduction
- In this work a fully Object Oriented Finite Element Solver is developed for solving 2D Transient Heat Conduction Problems.
- Solver is written in C++.
- Code can handle unstructured 2d triangular meshes of arbitrary geometries with different types of boundary conditions. (Constant Temperature, Heat Flux, Convection).
