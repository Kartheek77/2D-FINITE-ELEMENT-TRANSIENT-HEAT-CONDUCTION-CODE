# 2D-FINITE-ELEMENT-TRANSIENT-HEAT-CONDUCTION-CODE
Code supports different boundary conditions, works on any arbitrary 2d mesh generated in specified format
In this work a fully Object Oriented Finite Element Solver is developed for solving 2D Transient Heat Conduction Problems. C++ is used to code the solver. The code can handle triangular meshes of arbitrary geometries with different types of boundary conditions. (Constant Temperature, Heat Flux, Convection).
