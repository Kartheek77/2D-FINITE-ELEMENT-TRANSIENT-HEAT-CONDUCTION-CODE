### Finite Element Solver for Transient Heat Conduction
- Code supports different boundary conditions, works on any arbitrary 2d triangular mesh generated in specified format.
- In this work a fully Object Oriented Finite Element Solver is developed for solving 2D Transient Heat Conduction Problems. C++ is used to code the solver. The code can handle triangular meshes of arbitrary geometries with different types of boundary conditions. (Constant Temperature, Heat Flux, Convection).
